## Features

### Major

- [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)
- [BCRYPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
- [SCRYPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)
- [ARGON2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)
- optional _stealth-mode_ (zero-ing of arrays passed as input or transiently created)
- API for dealing with `char`/`byte` arrays as input (required for _stealth-mode_)

### Minor

- Support for values larger than 72 bytes) in BCrypt (truncate or SHA256)
- Highly configurable (with modern/safe defaults)
- Fully spec-ed (but not enforced) 
- Reflection-free (despite the heavy interop)
- Single dependency

## Why
Because Clojure deserves the best crypto-hashers ;)

## Where

TODO 

## Usage
There are two ways to leverage `cryptohash-clj`. 

### cryptohash-clj.api
This namespace contains two multi-methods:

- `hash-with [algo raw options]`
- `verify-with [algo raw options hashed]`

These will delegate to the right implementation according to the first parameter (`:pbkdf2`, `:bcrypt`, `:scrypt`). For example:

```clj
(hash-with :pbkdf2 "_sUpErSeCrEt@1234!_" {:iterations 100})

=> "ZA==$AMA=$hmac+sha256$czrJNQ7CJEbfY5v4$hPuUvHFyGiF3aiE9VBsZZ1AUSehKRbQo"

(verify-with :pbkdf2 "_sUpErSeCrEt@1234!_" {} *1)

=> true
```

Note that all the supported algorithms produce values that include the params in them so strictly speaking there shouldn't be a need
for passing any options to `verify-with`. However, there are some exceptions - for instance in pbkdf2 you can specify a custom separator 
(subject to validition). If you choose to do so, it needs to be known when verifying. Similarly with BCrypt and its 
`version` and `long-value` parameters. For complete piece of mind you can always rely on the defaults which are quite modern and safe (at the time of this writing).   

### cryptohash-clj.impl.{algorithm}
If you don't want to go via the multi-methods, you can go via the individual implementation namespaces.
Each of the three namespaces (`bcrypt.clj`, `scrypt.clj`, `pbkdf2.clj`, `argon2.clj`) contains two public functions:

- `chash  [raw opts]` 
- `verify [raw opts hashed]`

## Configuration details

#### PBKDF2
Can be configured with the following options:

- `:separator`  (defaults to `\$`)
- `:iterations` (defaults to `250,000`)
- `:algo` (defaults to `:hmac+sha512`, but `:hmac+sha256` and `:hmac+sha1` are valid choices)
- `:salt-length` (defaults to `16` bytes)
- `:key-length` (defaults to the native output length of `:algo` - 64, 32 and 20 bytes respectively)

I would advise **against** overriding the default `key-length`.
You should certainly avoid providing a number of bits (bytes * 8) greater than the native output length of your chosen `algo` 
as it makes life easier for an attacker. Providing less is safer, but since it won't save you any computation, it's 
best to stick with the native output length.  

#### BCRYPT

Can be configured with the following options:

- `:version` (defaults to `:v2y` but `:v2a` and `:v2b` are valid choices) 
- `:salt-length` (defaults to `16` bytes)
- `:cpu-cost` (defaults to `13`)
- `:long-value` (defaults to `:sha256`, but `:truncate` is a valid choice)

#### SCRYPT

Can be configured with the following options:

- `:salt-length` (defaults to `16` bytes)
- `:cpu-cost` (defaults to `15`) 
- `:mem-cost` (defaults to `8`)
- `:pfactor` (parallelization factor - defaults to `1`)

#### ARGON2

Can be configured with the following options:

- `:type` (defaults to `:argon2id`)
- `:version` (defaults to `:v13`)
- `:key-length` (defaults to `32` bytes)
- `:salt-length` (defaults to `16` bytes)
- `:secret` (bytes of some secret)
- `:additional` (additional bytes to include)
- `:iterations` (defaults to `1000`) 
- `:mem-cost` (defaults to `12`)

## Stealth mode

Stealth mode is controlled by `cryptohash-clj.stealth/*stealth?*` (bound to `true`). 
A convenience macro `with-stealth` is also provided in the same namespace for easy overriding.

## Secure random bytes (for salting etc.)

All random bytes are produced via a global instance of `SecureRandom` which lives in `cryptohash-clj.random/*PRNG*`.
A convenience macro `with-PRNG` is also provided in the same namespace for easy overriding.

## Defaults performance
This will, of course, vary from CPU to CPU, but all the defaults have been tuned to produce a time cost of around 500ms,
on this (relatively modern) MacBook-Pro (2.8GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz, with 6MB shared L3 cache) from 2017.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or above (strict)
- Clojure 1.10.1 or above  (relaxed)

## Alternatives
[crypto-password](https://github.com/weavejester/crypto-password) is the obvious alternative here.
However it lacks an api for bytes/chars (even if the underlying Java lib supports it), stealth-mode, 
and generally speaking is less configurable. Moreover, it comes with several dependencies.
However, that's **not** to say that if you're already using it and are perfectly content with it you should change.
